# Spatial Python Bootcamp 2023

### Materials for the Spatial Python portion of the Cart Spatial Data Science Bootcamp in September 2023

## Plan

### Introduction (5 Minutes) 

Begin the workshop by introducing the scope of spatial data science and how it integrates with GIS. Highlight the importance of spatial data science, how it is an evolution of traditional GIS methodologies and how it enables more complex analyses and data exploration techniques. Discuss how Python, as a general-purpose language, offers great flexibility and a powerful suite of libraries to perform spatial data science tasks.

Why: This sets the context for the workshop, linking the attendees' existing knowledge with the new concepts that will be introduced, and helping them understand the relevance and applicability of the skills they will be acquiring.

### Python and GIS: An Overview (10 Minutes)

Present an overview of Python's use in GIS, emphasizing its power, flexibility, and popularity. Discuss the most commonly used Python libraries in spatial data science, including Pandas, GeoPandas, Shapely, Fiona, PyProj, Rasterio, and Folium. Provide high-level overviews of what each library is used for.

Why: This gives attendees an overview of the ecosystem they'll be working within, and helps them understand where each tool fits into the larger picture.

### Hands-On: Using Notebooks for Spatial Data Science (5 Minutes) 

Introduce attendees to colab Python environments for spatial data science, including installing necessary libraries. Share resources on how to troubleshoot common installation issues, explain how notebooks work.

Why: This ensures that everyone has the necessary software installed and functioning correctly, which is critical for the rest of the workshop. It also introduces attendees to Jupyter Notebooks, an important tool in data science.

Link to additional resources: Detailed installation guides, FAQ or discussion forum for each of the libraries, tutorials on using Jupyter Notebooks.

### Hands-On: Reading, Writing and Visualizing Spatial Data with GeoPandas and Folium (30 Minutes)

Teach attendees how to read and write spatial data with GeoPandas. Discuss data types like GeoDataFrame and GeoSeries, and their relationship with Pandas DataFrame. Introduce basic visualization with Folium, demonstrating how to create interactive maps. Use a sample dataset for attendees to practice.

Why: These are foundational skills for working with spatial data in Python. GeoPandas extends the functionalities of Pandas, which is one of the most important tools in the data science toolbox. Folium, on the other hand, allows users to create different types of interactive maps, which are highly useful for visual spatial data exploration and presentation.

Link to additional resources: GeoPandas and Folium documentation, tutorials on spatial data visualization.

### Hands-On: Geometric Operations and Spatial Analysis with Shapely and GeoPandas (20 Minutes)

Explain geometric objects and operations in Shapely. Demonstrate how to perform spatial analyses using Shapely and GeoPandas, like spatial join, overlay, and buffer. Use the same sample dataset for attendees to practice.

Why: Geometric operations and spatial analyses are key components of spatial data science. Shapely is a vital library for geometric operations, and GeoPandas integrates Shapely's functionality to allow for sophisticated spatial analyses.

Link to additional resources: Shapely and GeoPandas documentation, tutorials on spatial analysis techniques.

### Conclusion and Further Resources (20 Minutes)

Wrap up by summarizing what was covered, encouraging attendees to continue practicing and exploring on their own. Share a curated list of resources, including advanced tutorials, relevant textbooks, online courses, and forums for further learning.

Why: This provides closure to the workshop and a path forward for those interested in delving deeper into spatial data science with Python.

Overall, this workshop is designed to provide a solid introduction to spatial data science in Python, focusing on practical, hands-on activities with some theory to build understanding. By the end of the workshop, attendees should have the basic skills needed to perform spatial data analyses in Python, and resources to continue their learning journey.
